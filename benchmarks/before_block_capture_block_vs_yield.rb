This attemps to measure the performance of how `routes` works in RSpec. It's
actually a method which delegates to `before`. RSpec executes `before` hooks by
capturing the block and then performing an `instance_exec` on it later in the
example context.

rspec-core has already performed [many related benchmarks about
this](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/tree/master/benchmarks):

- [call vs yield](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/benchmarks/call_v_yield.rb)
- [capture block vs yield](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/benchmarks/capture_block_vs_yield.rb)
- [flat map vs inject](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/master/benchmarks/flat_map_vs_inject.rb)

The results are very interesting:

> This benchmark demonstrates that capturing a block (e.g. `&block`) has
> a high constant cost, taking about 5x longer than a single `yield`
> (even if the block is never used!).
>
> However, fowarding a captured block can be faster than using `yield`

This seems to show that the error margin is enough to negate any benefit from
capturing the block initially. It also shows that not capturing the block is
still faster at low rates of calling. If this holds for your system, I think
this PR is good as is and we won't need to capture the block in the `route`
method, but still use `yield`.
