## `Small` issues

These issue are ones that we be believe are best suited for new contributors to
get started with. They represent a meaningful contribution to the project that
should not be too hard to pull off.

## Maintenance branches

Maintenance branches are how we manage the different supported point releases
of RSpec. As such, while they might look like good candidates to merge into
master, please do not open pull requests to merge them.
