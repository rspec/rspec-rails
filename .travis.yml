# We deviate from the rspec-dev cache setting here.
#
# Travis has special bundler support where it knows to run `bundle clean`
# before backing up the bundle so it doesn't grow indefinitely.
#
# For the other repos we changed to specifying the directory specifically to
# avoid the `bundle clean` travis was doing, because Myron found that, when
# running one of the a build for one repo, the "run the rspec-core and
# rspec-rails spec suites" parts would take a while because it would _always_
# have to install fresh gems (they weren't in the cache). This was happening
# because travis was running `bundle clean` (due to the previous `cache:
# bundler` config) against one repo which was was pruning gems installed for
# the other repos.
#
# In our case, we aren't running the spec suites for the other repos so the
# original `cache: bundler` is a better option.
