Feature: view spec

  View specs are marked by `:type => :view`
  or if you have set `config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!`
  by placing them in `spec/views`.

  Use them to test the content of view templates
  without invoking a specific controller.
  They generally follow three steps:

  ```ruby
  assign(:widget, Widget.new)  # sets @widget = Widget.new in the view template

  render

  expect(rendered).to match(/text/)
  ```

  1. Use the `assign` method to set instance variables in the view.

  2. Use the `render` method to render the view.

  3. Set expectations against the resulting rendered template.

  Scenario: View specs render the described view file
    Given a file named "spec/views/widgets/index.html.erb_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby

            Widget.create!(:name => "slicer"),
            Widget.create!(:name => "dicer")
