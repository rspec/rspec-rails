Feature: route_to matcher

  The `route_to` matcher specifies that a request (verb + path) is routable.
  It is most valuable when specifying routes other than standard RESTful
  routes.

      expect(get("/")).to route_to("welcome#index") # new in 2.6.0

      or

      expect(:get => "/").to route_to(:controller => "welcome")

  Scenario: passing route spec with shortcut syntax
    Given a file named "spec/routing/widgets_routing_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require "spec_helper"

      describe "routes for Widgets" do
        it "routes /widgets to the widgets controller" do
          expect(get("/widgets")).
            to route_to("widgets#index")
        end
      end
      """

    When I run `rspec spec/routing/widgets_routing_spec.rb`
    Then the examples should all pass

  Scenario: passing route spec with verbose syntax
