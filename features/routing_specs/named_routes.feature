Feature: named routes

  Routing specs have access to named routes.

  Scenario: access named route
    Given a file named "spec/routing/widget_routes_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require "rails_helper"

      RSpec.describe "routes to the widgets controller", type: :routing do
        it "routes a named route" do
          expect(:get => new_widget_path).
            to route_to(:controller => "widgets", :action => "new")
        end
      end
      """
    When I run `rspec spec`
    Then the examples should all pass
