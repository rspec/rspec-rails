Routing specs are marked by `type: :routing` or if you have set
`config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!` by placing them in `spec/routing`.

Simple apps with nothing but standard RESTful routes won't get much value from
routing specs, but they can provide significant value when used to specify
customized routes, like vanity links, slugs, etc.

    expect(:get => "/articles/2012/11/when-to-use-routing-specs").to route_to(
      :controller => "articles",
      :month => "2012-11",
      :slug => "when-to-use-routing-specs"
    )

They are also valuable for routes that should not be available:

    expect(:delete => "/accounts/37").not_to be_routable
