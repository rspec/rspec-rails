Feature: have_performed_job matcher

  The `have_performed_job` (also aliased as `enqueue_job`) matcher is used to check if given ActiveJob job was performed.

  Background:
    Given active job is available

  Scenario: Checking job class name
    Given a file named "spec/jobs/upload_backups_job_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require "rails_helper"

      RSpec.describe UploadBackupsJob do
        it "matches with performed job" do
          ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter = :test
          ActiveJob::Base.queue_adapter.perform_enqueued_jobs = true
          expect {
