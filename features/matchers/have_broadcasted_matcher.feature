Feature: have_broadcasted matcher

  The `have_broadcasted_to` (also aliased as `broadcast_to`) matcher is used
  to check if a message has been broadcasted to a given stream.

  Background:
    Given action cable testing is available

  Scenario: Checking stream name
    Given a file named "spec/models/broadcaster_spec.rb" with:
      """ruby
      require "rails_helper"

      RSpec.describe "broadcasting" do

              "notifications", { text: "Hello!" }
            )
