Feature: job spec

  Job specs provide alternative assertions to those available in
  `ActiveJob::TestHelper` and help assert behaviour of the jobs themselves
  and that other entities correctly enqueue them.

  Job specs are marked by `:type => :job` or if you have set
  `config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!` by placing them in `spec/jobs`.

  With job specs, you can:

  * specify the job class which was enqueued
  * specify the arguments passed to the job
  * specify when the job was enqueued until
  * specify the queue which the job was enqueued to

  Check the documentation on
  [`have_been_enqueued`](matchers/have-been-enqueued-matcher) and
  [`have_enqueued_job`](matchers/have-enqueued-job-matcher) for more
  information.

  Background:
