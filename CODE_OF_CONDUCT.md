# Contributor Code of Conduct

For the purpose of building a welcoming, harassment-free community that
values contributions from anyone, the RSpec project has adopted the
following code of conduct. All contributors and participants (including
maintainers!) are expected to abide by its terms.

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests,
updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other
activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion or similar personal characteristic.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include, but are not limited
to, the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal
attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other
unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not
follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project
maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor
Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.1.0, available at
